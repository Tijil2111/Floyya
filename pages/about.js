            I am also a student in ninth grade. At first, I was so honoured that
            my seniors had asked me to participate in a competition with them

            to know about the product I was immensely moved by it.

            I know that most people would shy away or feel embarrassed to talk

            Iâ€™m in class 11th. From a very young age, I was always passionate

            for me but for every other girl I know. And I realized this more in
            the lockdown when while talking to our househelp and her daughter.

        Sanitary pads - still one of the most stigmatised topics of our society.
        Menstruation is still considered a taboo in Indian society. Even today,
        the cultural and social influences prevent adolescent girls from getting
        proper knowledge or protection on menstrual hygiene.This is not
        something that should be discriminated against on the basis of urban and
        rural. While the women in the urban areas definitely are in a better
        condition than the ones in rural areas whose sanitary conditions are
        terrible, they too have their fair share of hardships.
      </div>
      <div className=" p-10 pt-1 pb-20 text-center font-poppinsLight text-[20px]">
        The lockdown had seen girls and women resorting to using socks and old
        newspapers during menstruation times as sanitary items became either
        expensive or harder to procure. Because when most of the shops were
        selling basic necessities for a reduced price we noticed that women
        hygiene products such as Sanitary napkins were not included in that
        list. Floyya is a teen initiative to provide sanitary napkins to the
        people who need them and to destigmatize the taboo still prevalent in
        our country through various steps taken. Being a teen, i.e the the
        future of our nation, we believe that it is our moral responsibility to
        break the age old stereotypes and normalise the topic of menstruation,
        especially for the male section of the society.
